# single-frame Low illumination image enhancemnt
 - [x] LLNet: A Deep Autoencoder approach to Natural Low-light Image
Enhancement  
      Description: the early learning based work of low illumination image enhancement; simulated dark datasets; conventional methods comparison. 
 - [x] MSR-net:Low-light Image Enhancement Using Deep Convolutional Network
      Description: multi-scale logarithmatic processing for multi-scale retinex simultation?; Analogy between convolution and difference of Gaussian; color restoration function with 1x1 conv; 
      - [ ] have no idea why and how adopt log space?( learn the code later)
 - [x] Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement
      Description: interersting work! decompose the image into constant reflectance and illumination and then enhance the illumation map to reconstruct the normal light image.
      - [ ] try the code to find if any lighting condition.
